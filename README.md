# traffic_light_controller
I implemented a real-time traffic signal controller on a Spartan-7 FPGA using Verilog HDL, integrating pedestrian signals with precise timing logic to enhance traffic flow and safety. The design was simulated and verified in Xilinx Vivado before deployment, demonstrating efficient, reliable, and scalable traffic management.
